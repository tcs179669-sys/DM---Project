# DM---Project
This project implements a Basic Cryptographic Suite that demonstrates how fundamental concepts from number theory and discrete mathematics are applied in classical and modern cryptography.The project includes implementations of Caesar Cipher, Affine Cipher, and RSA Cryptosystem, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt text through a menu-driven command-line interface
